To Do List
==========

Manage special calls with files outputs, manage subcalls that return multiple
values for a given object: this should be solved by call alteration hooks.
  ex.: /seedlots/{seedLotDbId}/transactions
  BrapiController.php, in processQueryObjectCalls(), line 565.
  // @todo: also check for sub-calls that may have an identifier in the filter

Fix code @todo.

Improve interface access token management.
  - add admin interface for global management (interface BrapiToken::purgeExpiredTokens())
  - possibility to create permanent tokens (expiration = -1)

Documentation.

Add automated tests.
  /tests directory.

Manual (UI) tests to check BrAPI specifications compliance.
  Should include a call test page to check BrAPI compliance against specs.

Support Drupal config export.

Auto-generates content type fields to match a BrAPI object model.
